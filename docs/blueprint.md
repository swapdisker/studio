## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to give a sense of calm, exploration, and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4FF). The background matches the blue primary hue and makes the dark blue pop. A very light tint ensures comfortable readability, befitting the calm style of the app.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#673AB7) as an analogous color to bring some contrast without disrupting the app's calm vibe.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Panels with rounded corners, emulating the design of Gemini/ChatGPT for the chatbot interface, promoting easy viewing and streamlined aesthetics.
- The panels must never overlap with each other.
- Use minimalist icons that clearly represent actions and categories; keep with user expectations for map markers and typical calendar visuals.
